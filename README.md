## C STL
**C STL** is a project that is intended to mimic several data structures that are provided in the modern C++ STL specification.  
The implementations were **NOT* designed to be identical, however many of the same functionalities are in place. These are  
standard data structures utilized within **Computer Science**. Furthermore, they include some of the following:  

    Hashmap  
    Queue (FIFO)  
    Stack (LIFO)  
    
    and more..

The source code for each file is provided in the **ds** folder (short for data structures). Additionally, integration tests that  
show and describe how you may use these data structures are provided in the **tests** folder.  

## Compiling Tests

The provided tests have been tested on a **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** operating system and compiled using **gcc**. Simply put, you may
compile and run these tests using the following syntax:

    ```
    gcc <test_c_file>
    ```

This will compile the file into an executable called **a.out**. Lastly, you may run this executable as follows:

    ```
    ./a.out
    ```
